    Given a list of strings, find the ones that are palindromes.

    Palindromes are the same forward as they are backwards, such as "mom" or "racecar".

    If the same word appears more than once, it should only appear once in the output!

    Parameters:
        words: list[str] - List of words to analyze.

    Returns:
        list of words that are palindromes from the given word list, in
